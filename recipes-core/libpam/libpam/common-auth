#
# /etc/pam.d/common-auth - authentication settings common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of the authentication modules that define
# the central authentication scheme for use on the system
# (e.g., /etc/shadow, LDAP, Kerberos, etc.).  The default is to use the
# traditional Unix authentication mechanisms.

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
auth	required			pam_faillock.so preauth audit deny=3 unlock_time=0 silent
auth	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth	[default=die]			pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 unlock_time=0
auth	sufficient			pam_faillock.so authsucc audit deny=3 unlock_time=0
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
auth	requisite			pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
auth	required			pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
